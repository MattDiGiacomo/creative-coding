        <dd> This project was one of my favorites to complete because I felt like it was rather challenging at first, but I was able to create whatever I wanted expressing emotion, so I chose the one I felt while making it </dd>

        <dd>This game was a complete wrap up of all of my knowledge that I gained during this class, having the game be a one button game where you click the button, and it will chnge the color of the background as well as the score for 10 seconds. </dd>
