        <dd> This was our first project that we completed in this class, and I feel like it was the building blocks of all the code I am able to do now</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://mattdigiacomo.github.io/creative-coding/unit2/Anger-Emoji/">Anger Emoji</a></dt>
        <dd> This project was one of my favorites to complete because I felt like it was rather challenging at first, but I was able to create whatever I wanted expressing emotion, so I chose the one I felt while making it </dd>
        <dt><a href="https://mattdigiacomo.github.io/creative-coding/unit3/time/">Crazy Clock</a></dt>
        <dd> This project had a lot more time brainstorming than coding, because displaying time in an obsturct way was difficult, but I was able to have the shapes move and flash at different rates in relation to differnet segments of time</dd>
         <dt><a href="https://mattdigiacomo.github.io/creative-coding/unit5/final/">Click Me Game!</a></dt>
        <dd>This game was a complete wrap up of all of my knowledge that I gained during this class, having the game be a one button game where you click the button, and it will chnge the color of the background as well as the score for 10 seconds. </dd>
